## Overview of the architecture

This webpage is designed to fetch information of a product from an API and displaying it.
The product has options for add-ons with a quantity rocker next to each option for the user to interact with and choose how many of each option they would like to add to their cart. The quantity rocker(s) has a button on each side which increments and decrements the quantity and updates the summary to show the quantity of each option chosen and the price of each option according to their quantity and the end of the summary shows the total price of all the options added together.

## Summary

I used plain JavaScript, CSS and HTML to create this website using the Atom IDE.
If I were to do it again, I would use a framework like Angular or React after doing thorough research on the frameworks.
